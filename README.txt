The following C# code snippets are taken from the exercises found in:
https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/basic/index.php

Each heading from the left hand side of w3resource will be its own top level folder.

From there, a selection of exercise will be done since there is no time to do all of them.

The way I've set up the project folder is such that Basic.csproj needs to be changed to point to the .cs file that needs to be run at any one time.
